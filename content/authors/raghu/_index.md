Hello! I am Raghunath. I am currently a Master's Student in Computer Engineering at New York University.
I have experience in a variety of cross-sections including Software Development, Data Analysis, Embedded Systems, and Computer Networks, and have worked on a research project on the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT).

Last Summer I joined Tavant Technologies as a Data Science Intern and developed an error prediction system.

I am actively looking for New Graduate Engineer Positions starting in the Summer of 2021. Please feel free to contact me though [email](mailto:raghu@caramail.com) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/r17)
